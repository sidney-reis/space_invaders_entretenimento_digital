# CGF #

This is a simple game framework with a focus on academic applications.
The framework is based on SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), which already provides most of the low level stuff.

### Quick start ###

* Clone or download the repository contents
* The repository contains a precompiled version of the library for Linux 64 bits (compiled on Mint 17.1), Windows and OSX (Compiled on Mavericks).
* Examples can be found in the "examples" directory. Each has corresponding project files.
* In order to rebuild the library, the "build" directory contains build files (projects) for Code::Blocks and QtCreator. Each directory also has a README file.
